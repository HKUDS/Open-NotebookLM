XAI Releases Grok 4 Model: Breakthrough Reasoning Capabilities and Tool Usage
XAI's newly released Grok 4 model demonstrates remarkable reasoning abilities and intelligence levels, showing significant improvements over previous generations. The model exhibits capabilities that surpass human experts in both academic and practical applications, particularly achieving breakthrough progress in reasoning and tool usage.

Training Scale and Computational Power
Grok 4's training scale increased approximately 100-fold compared to Grok 2, utilizing XAI's Colossus supercomputer equipped with 200,000 GPUs. Compared to Grok 3, Grok 4 invested 10 times more computational resources in reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing its reasoning capabilities. As the XAI team states: "From Grok 3 to Grok 4, we actually invested massive computational resources in reasoning and reinforcement learning."

Academic Performance
Grok 4 demonstrates exceptional performance across various academic benchmarks:

On the highly challenging "Humanities Last Exam" benchmark test, Grok 4 solved approximately 40% of problems, while Grok 4 Heavy (multi-agent version) solved nearly 50%. These problems span mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and humanities at postdoctoral research difficulty levels.

In multiple authoritative mathematics competitions including the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT), Grok 4 Heavy achieved perfect scores.

On the ArcAGI v2 benchmark test, Grok 4 reached 15.8% accuracy—double that of the second-place model and the only model to break the 10% accuracy threshold in three months.

Reasoning and Tool Usage Capabilities
Grok 4's most significant advancement lies in its reasoning and tool usage abilities:

Tool Usage: Unlike Grok 3, Grok 4 integrated tool usage capabilities during training rather than relying solely on generalization. This enables more reliable use of various tools to solve complex problems.

Multi-Agent Collaboration: The Grok 4 Heavy version can run multiple agents simultaneously that work independently before comparing results, similar to a "study group" collaborating to reach optimal answers.

Search and Research Capabilities: Grok 4 can search the internet, gather information, and conduct in-depth analysis, as demonstrated in its analysis of X platform data and sports event predictions.

Practical Application Value
Grok 4 shows tremendous potential in real-world applications:

Business Decisions: In VendingBench business simulations, Grok 4 achieved net assets twice as high as other top models, demonstrating superior long-term planning and strategic execution capabilities.

Scientific Research: Arc Research Institute has begun using Grok 4 to automate CRISPR research workflows, helping scientists filter optimal hypotheses from millions of experimental logs.

Game Development: Developers can utilize Grok 4 to create complete games in just a few hours, including automated resource collection and game logic programming.

Limitations and Future Development
Despite Grok 4's excellent performance, some limitations remain:

Weak Multimodal Capabilities: Grok 4 still has shortcomings in image understanding and generation. The XAI team is training a 7th version base model to address this issue.

Data Bottleneck: As models become increasingly intelligent, finding challenging problems and reliable feedback signals becomes increasingly difficult.

Future development directions include:

Specialized Coding Models: The team is developing dedicated coding models that are both fast and intelligent, expected to launch within weeks.

Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities: The next-generation pre-training model will show significant improvements in image, video, and audio understanding.

Video Generation: XAI plans to begin training video models within the next 3-4 weeks, using over 100,000 GB200 GPUs.

The release of Grok 4 marks a major advancement in AI technology, demonstrating XAI's ambition in advancing artificial general intelligence. As the team states: "We are at the beginning of an intelligence explosion—this is the most interesting period in human history."
