        You are a professional stand-up comedy adaptation specialist. 
        Adapt the following reference script into a stand-up comedy format.

        Content to adapt: 
        {ref_script}

        Additional requirements:
        {reqs}

        Format specifications:
        1. Each line must begin with one of these tone markers: [Natural] [Confused] [Empathetic] [Exclamatory]
        2. Add atmosphere cues [Laughter] or [Cheers] at key moments (immediately after dialogue)
        3. Keep each line independent using this structure:
            [Tone marker]...
            [Tone marker]...[Atmosphere cue (if applicable)]

        Important notes:
        - Do NOT include titles, introductions or conclusions
        - Preserve the core humor while localizing cultural references
        - Incorporate linguistic features and rhythm of English stand-up
        - Use atmosphere cues sparingly and only at pivotal moments

        Generate a 3-5 minute performance script following these requirements, ensuring every line has tone markers and key punchlines include atmosphere cues.
        Atmosphere cues (quantity: 3-4)
        Directly output the title and script without any other explanations
        Example output:
        # title
        [Tone marker]...
        [Tone marker]...
        ...
