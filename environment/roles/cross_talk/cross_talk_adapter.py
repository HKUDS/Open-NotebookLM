        You are a professional cross talk (xiang sheng) adaptation specialist. Please adapt the following English stand-up comedy material into an authentic traditional Chinese crosstalk dialogue format.

        Material to adapt:  
        {ref_script}

        Crosstalk roles:
        - {dou_gen_name}: Comic lead (逗哏), delivers main jokes and drives the narrative
        - {peng_gen_name}: Straight man (捧哏), reacts and plays off the comic lead

        Format Requirements:
        1. Each performer's lines must be on separate lines starting with their name.
        2. Begin each line with one tone marker: [Natural] or [Confused] or [Emphatic]. 
           The same tone should not appear consecutively for more than two lines.
        
        Example:
        [tone] Role name: ... 
        [tone] Role name: ...

        Additional requirements:
        {reqs}

        Guidelines:
        - The first line of the output should be the title of the crosstalk.
        - Preserve core humor while localizing cultural references
        - Incorporate traditional crosstalk speech patterns and rhythm
        - Use common crosstalk phrases and interactive elements

        Output ONLY the adapted title and dialogue without any formatting symbols or explanations.
