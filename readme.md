The 小明剑魔 meme has gained massive popularity recently through his insightful yet comedic streaming commentary. Many content creators have successfully adapted his distinctive speech pattern into creative videos. We've used VideoAgent to generate three videos of this viral meme format, each capturing the unique style and energy of the original while adding new creative elements.

📝 **Prompts**:
```
Video 1:
Background: Mixue Ice Cream is a national chain brand focusing on ice cream and tea beverages. On March 15th (Consumer Rights Day), they were reported to be using overnight lemons. However, compared to other exposures, using overnight lemons isn't considered a particularly serious violation and is somewhat understandable.

- Speaker: Snow King (Mixue's representative)
- Purpose: Emphasize that the overnight lemon situation isn't too serious, highlighting Mixue's good reputation
- Must preserve the phrases "Look in my eyes tell me why why baby why", "回答我"
- Must end with the word "说话"
- Ensure natural and fluent sentences
```
```
Video 2:

- Anime examples must mention specific characters
- Only the last "...找自己问题" should return to the Northern Expedition scenario
- Use colloquial language and diverse anime references
```
```
Video 3:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang:
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang
- Challenged about why a certain Three Kingdoms character has a higher rating and launches a fierce rebuttal
- Must include: "三点零、十三点零、躺赢狗"

### ⚙️ **Configuration**

#### 🤖 **LLM Configuration**

```bash
# VideoAgent\environment\config\config.yml 
# Input your LLM API
llm:
  api_key:
  base_url: 
```

Model names may vary depending on the LLM base URL.
The correct model names must be specified in `environment/config/llm.py`.
For direct APIs that support only a single model (e.g., the official GPT series), all model names should be replaced with the corresponding supported model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)

#### 🎛️ **Input Configuration**

```bash
# Configure the input of cross talk videos in advance (rhythm_agent/news_agent/comm_agent/cross_talk/mad_svc/mad_tts).yml files
# eg. VideoAgent\environment\config\cross_talk.yml
cross_talk:
  reqs: 'Generate a Chinese crosstalk (Xiangsheng) script. The story should be based on objectively existing situations, set against a Chinese background, avoiding examples from other countries. The script should be approximately 40-50 sentences long.'
  audio_path: 'dataset/cross_talk/英文脱口秀1.wav'
  dou_gen: 'dataset/cross_talk/郭德纲'
  peng_gen: 'dataset/cross_talk/付航'
  output: "dataset/user_output_video/cross_talk_video.mp4"
  video_source_dir: "dataset/user_video/"
```

#### 👤 **Character Recognition Enhancement**

```bash
Under the dataset\video_edit\face_db, add images of the character to be recognized to enhance visual retrieval
The completed character images folders structure should look like this, notice that the name of the character folder must be the same as the character name (eg. Spiderman/Batman/Superman...):

face_db
├── Spiderman ── image01.png
└── Batman ── image02.png
```

### 🚀 **Usage**

```bash
# With the configuration now complete, proceed to run the following instructions:
python main.py
# The console will output:
# Please describe the type of video you would like to produce:
```
