##### 🤖 **1.1 *Grok 4 Released***

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtYsUdfZPMA&t=26s" target='_blank'><img src="assets/grok4.png" width=60%/></a>

📝 **Summarization Demo**:
```
XAI Releases Grok 4 Model: Breakthrough Reasoning Capabilities and Tool Usage
XAI's newly released Grok 4 model demonstrates remarkable reasoning abilities and intelligence levels, showing significant improvements over previous generations. The model exhibits capabilities that surpass human experts in both academic and practical applications, particularly achieving breakthrough progress in reasoning and tool usage.

Training Scale and Computational Power
Grok 4's training scale increased approximately 100-fold compared to Grok 2, utilizing XAI's Colossus supercomputer equipped with 200,000 GPUs. Compared to Grok 3, Grok 4 invested 10 times more computational resources in reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing its reasoning capabilities. As the XAI team states: "From Grok 3 to Grok 4, we actually invested massive computational resources in reasoning and reinforcement learning."

Academic Performance
Grok 4 demonstrates exceptional performance across various academic benchmarks:

On the highly challenging "Humanities Last Exam" benchmark test, Grok 4 solved approximately 40% of problems, while Grok 4 Heavy (multi-agent version) solved nearly 50%. These problems span mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and humanities at postdoctoral research difficulty levels.

In multiple authoritative mathematics competitions including the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO) and Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT), Grok 4 Heavy achieved perfect scores.

On the ArcAGI v2 benchmark test, Grok 4 reached 15.8% accuracy—double that of the second-place model and the only model to break the 10% accuracy threshold in three months.

Reasoning and Tool Usage Capabilities
Grok 4's most significant advancement lies in its reasoning and tool usage abilities:

Tool Usage: Unlike Grok 3, Grok 4 integrated tool usage capabilities during training rather than relying solely on generalization. This enables more reliable use of various tools to solve complex problems.

Multi-Agent Collaboration: The Grok 4 Heavy version can run multiple agents simultaneously that work independently before comparing results, similar to a "study group" collaborating to reach optimal answers.

Search and Research Capabilities: Grok 4 can search the internet, gather information, and conduct in-depth analysis, as demonstrated in its analysis of X platform data and sports event predictions.

Practical Application Value
Grok 4 shows tremendous potential in real-world applications:

Business Decisions: In VendingBench business simulations, Grok 4 achieved net assets twice as high as other top models, demonstrating superior long-term planning and strategic execution capabilities.

Scientific Research: Arc Research Institute has begun using Grok 4 to automate CRISPR research workflows, helping scientists filter optimal hypotheses from millions of experimental logs.

Game Development: Developers can utilize Grok 4 to create complete games in just a few hours, including automated resource collection and game logic programming.

Limitations and Future Development
Despite Grok 4's excellent performance, some limitations remain:

Weak Multimodal Capabilities: Grok 4 still has shortcomings in image understanding and generation. The XAI team is training a 7th version base model to address this issue.

Data Bottleneck: As models become increasingly intelligent, finding challenging problems and reliable feedback signals becomes increasingly difficult.

Future development directions include:

Specialized Coding Models: The team is developing dedicated coding models that are both fast and intelligent, expected to launch within weeks.

Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities: The next-generation pre-training model will show significant improvements in image, video, and audio understanding.

Video Generation: XAI plans to begin training video models within the next 3-4 weeks, using over 100,000 GB200 GPUs.

The release of Grok 4 marks a major advancement in AI technology, demonstrating XAI's ambition in advancing artificial general intelligence. As the team states: "We are at the beginning of an intelligence explosion—this is the most interesting period in human history."

The 小明剑魔 meme has gained massive popularity recently through his insightful yet comedic streaming commentary. Many content creators have successfully adapted his distinctive speech pattern into creative videos. We've used VideoAgent to generate three videos of this viral meme format, each capturing the unique style and energy of the original while adding new creative elements.

📝 **Prompts**:
```
Video 1:
Background: Mixue Ice Cream is a national chain brand focusing on ice cream and tea beverages. On March 15th (Consumer Rights Day), they were reported to be using overnight lemons. However, compared to other exposures, using overnight lemons isn't considered a particularly serious violation and is somewhat understandable.

- Speaker: Snow King (Mixue's representative)
- Purpose: Emphasize that the overnight lemon situation isn't too serious, highlighting Mixue's good reputation
- Must preserve the phrases "Look in my eyes tell me why why baby why", "回答我"
- Must end with the word "说话"
- Ensure natural and fluent sentences
```
```
Video 2:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang:
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang
- Start with "北伐失败怎么不找找自己问题" (Why don't you look at your own problems for the failure of the Northern Expedition), followed by "...找自己问题" pattern sentences that all reference anime events
- Anime examples must mention specific characters
- Only the last "...找自己问题" should return to the Northern Expedition scenario
- Use colloquial language and diverse anime references
```
```
Video 3:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang:
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang
- Challenged about why a certain Three Kingdoms character has a higher rating and launches a fierce rebuttal
- Must include: "三点零、十三点零、躺赢狗"
- Do not start with "零杠几"
- Later rating comparisons should show stark differences (can be exaggerated)
- Use colloquial language, align with historical facts
```

📝 **Prompts**:
```
The song is performed by Patrick Star, focusing on the theme of "the struggles of manuscript submission and dealing with overly critical reviewers", following the original lyrics' sentence structure while replacing specific content. It incorporates elements of reviewer nitpicking (e.g., questioning innovation, demanding redundant experiments) and expresses frustration with lines like "If only I could swap reviewers, this academic fate is too cruel" to highlight the emotional toll of peer review.
```
