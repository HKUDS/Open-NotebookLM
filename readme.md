# XAI发布Grok 4模型：突破性的推理能力与工具使用

XAI公司最新发布的Grok 4模型展现了惊人的推理能力和智能水平，相比前代产品有显著提升。该模型在学术和实际应用方面都展现出超越人类专家的能力，尤其在推理和工具使用方面取得了突破性进展。

## 训练规模与计算能力

Grok 4的训练规模较Grok 2增加了约100倍，利用了XAI的Colossus超级计算机，配备了200,000个GPU。与Grok 3相比，Grok 4在强化学习方面投入了10倍的计算资源，这使其推理能力得到显著提升。正如XAI团队所述："从Grok 3到Grok 4，我们实际上在推理和强化学习方面投入了大量计算资源。"

## 学术能力表现

Grok 4在各类学术基准测试中表现卓越：

1. 在"人文学科最终考试"(Humanities Last Exam)这一极具挑战性的基准测试中，Grok 4解决了约40%的问题，而Grok 4 Heavy(多智能体版本)解决了近50%的问题。这些问题涵盖数学、自然科学、工程学和人文学科，难度达到博士后研究水平。

2. 在美国数学奥林匹克竞赛(USAMO)、哈佛-MIT数学竞赛(HMMT)等多个权威数学竞赛中，Grok 4 Heavy获得了满分。

3. 在ArcAGI v2基准测试中，Grok 4达到了15.8%的准确率，是第二名的两倍，成为三个月内唯一突破10%准确率的模型。

## 推理与工具使用能力

Grok 4最显著的进步在于其推理能力和工具使用能力：

1. 工具使用：与Grok 3不同，Grok 4在训练过程中就整合了工具使用能力，而不仅仅依赖泛化。这使其能够更可靠地使用各种工具解决复杂问题。

2. 多智能体协作：Grok 4 Heavy版本能够同时运行多个智能体，它们独立工作后比较结果，类似于"学习小组"，共同得出最佳答案。

3. 搜索与研究能力：Grok 4能够搜索互联网，收集信息，并进行深入分析，如在演示中展示的对X平台数据的分析和体育赛事预测。

## 实际应用价值

Grok 4在实际应用中展现出巨大潜力：

1. 商业决策：在VendingBench商业模拟中，Grok 4实现了比其他顶级模型高出两倍的净资产，展示了其长期规划和战略执行能力。

2. 科学研究：Arc研究所已经开始使用Grok 4来自动化CRISPR研究流程，帮助科学家从数百万实验日志中筛选最佳假设。

3. 游戏开发：开发者能够利用Grok 4在短短几小时内创建完整的游戏，包括自动化资源收集和游戏逻辑编写。

## 局限与未来发展

尽管Grok 4表现出色，但仍存在一些局限：

1. 多模态能力较弱：Grok 4在图像理解和生成方面仍有不足，XAI团队正在训练第7版基础模型来解决这一问题。

2. 数据瓶颈：随着模型变得越来越智能，找到具有挑战性的问题和可靠的反馈信号变得越来越困难。

未来发展方向包括：

1. 专门的编码模型：团队正在开发既快速又智能的专用编码模型，预计将在几周内推出。

2. 多模态能力提升：下一代预训练模型将在图像、视频和音频理解方面有显著提升。

3. 视频生成：XAI计划在未来3-4周内开始训练视频模型，使用超过100,000个GB200 GPU。

Grok 4的发布标志着AI技术的重大进步，展示了XAI在推动通用人工智能发展方面的雄心。正如团队所言："我们正处于智能大爆炸的开始，这是人类历史上最有趣的时期。"

</table>

The 小明剑魔 meme has gained massive popularity recently through his insightful yet comedic streaming commentary. Many content creators have successfully adapted his distinctive speech pattern into creative videos. We've used VideoAgent to generate three videos of this viral meme format, each capturing the unique style and energy of the original while adding new creative elements.

📝 **Prompts**:
```
Video 1:
Background: Mixue Ice Cream is a national chain brand focusing on ice cream and tea beverages. On March 15th (Consumer Rights Day), they were reported to be using overnight lemons. However, compared to other exposures, using overnight lemons isn't considered a particularly serious violation and is somewhat understandable.

- Speaker: Snow King (Mixue's representative)
- Purpose: Emphasize that the overnight lemon situation isn't too serious, highlighting Mixue's good reputation
- Must preserve the phrases "Look in my eyes tell me why why baby why", "回答我"
- Must end with the word "说话"
- Ensure natural and fluent sentences
```
```
Video 2:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang:
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang
- Start with "北伐失败怎么不找找自己问题" (Why don't you look at your own problems for the failure of the Northern Expedition), followed by "...找自己问题" pattern sentences that all reference anime events
- Anime examples must mention specific characters
- Only the last "...找自己问题" should return to the Northern Expedition scenario
- Use colloquial language and diverse anime references
```
```
Video 3:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang:
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang
- Challenged about why a certain Three Kingdoms character has a higher rating and launches a fierce rebuttal
- Must include: "三点零、十三点零、躺赢狗"
- Do not start with "零杠几"
- Later rating comparisons should show stark differences (can be exaggerated)
- Use colloquial language, align with historical facts

User Requirement: ...
# Requirement Example:
# 1. I need to create a reworded version of an existing video where the speech content is modified while maintaining the original speaker's voice. The video should have the same visuals as the original, but with updated dialogue that follows my specific requirements.
# 2. I have a standup comedy script that I'd like to turn into a professional-looking video. I need the script to be performed with good comedic timing and audience reactions, then matched with relevant video footage to create a complete standup comedy special. I already have a reference script and some footage I want to use for the video.
